The SFS Generator is a program used to create SFS solar systems.
It has a moderately simple GUI that allows you to enter inputs.
The galaxy selector and heightmap generator are currently work in progress.
It's not recommended to put more than 16 star systems.
do NOT try to add more than 25 planets per system, this will annihilate SFS.
