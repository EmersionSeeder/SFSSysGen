# The SFS Generator
The SFS Generator is a TKINTER program used to create SFS solar systems.
# Features and W.I.Ps
- It has a moderately simple GUI that allows you to enter inputs.
- The galaxy selector and heightmap generator are currently work in progress.
# DOS and DON'TS
- It's not recommended to put more than 16 star systems.
- do NOT try to add more than 25 planets per system, this will annihilate SFS.
- If you are lazy, use [the autopacker](https://github.com/EmersionSeeder/SFSSysPacker/tree/main/System%20Autopacker) to automatically pack assets into a custom solar system pack.
# Instructions
- If you remember everything on the previous sections, here is how you install this mess.
1. Open PowerShell
2. Run these commands one-by-one:
   
  ```python pip install pygame```

  ```python pip install pydub```
  
  ```python pip install pillow```
  
  ```python pip install simpleaudio```
 If it doesn't recognize "python", use "py.exe" instead.
 If it doesn't recognize "pip", use "-m pip" instead.
3. Place the SFS Generator Folder anywhere
4. Run the python script
5. Good to go!
