The SFS Generator is a program used to create SFS solar systems.
- It has a moderately simple GUI that allows you to enter inputs.
- The galaxy selector and heightmap generator are currently work in progress.
- It's not recommended to put more than 16 star systems.
- do NOT try to add more than 25 planets per system, this will annihilate SFS.
- If you are lazy, use [the autopacker](https://github.com/EmersionSeeder/SFSSysPacker/tree/main/System%20Autopacker) to automatically pack assets into a custom solar system pack.
